% This code runs a gravity regression of the type in Eaton and Kortum (2002) or in Waugh (2010).
% The code calls stata to run a very simple regression using their
% powerfull tools to incoperate various fixed-effects. It then constructs
% trade costs and simmulates an equillibrium. 
%
% A note on the organization of tradeshare matrix and tradecost matrix.
% This is always setup so that a row is an importer, and a column is an
% exporter.

theta = 4; % Pick a \theta parameter.

% This calls the stata program ``gravity_run.do''. Note this is callable on
% its own. But make sure to remove the final line ``exit'' in the code to
% see the output in stata. Note will have to change the directory to find
% stata on your computere.

N = (length(beta)-7)/2; 

% This is the number of countries. Why? Stata writes the coeffecients with
% the base set to zero. So there are 2*N fixed effects. Then one can look
% and see that country 1's are all set to zero... So subtract off the parts
% for distance and border, divide by two and you have the number of
% countries

asym_est = beta(1:N) - ssd_stata; 
% Then the difference in exporter and importer effects is the assymetric
% component. 


% Now convert this into trade cost levels
asym = exp(-(1./theta).*asym_est)-1; % The asymetric component...

dist = exp(-(1./theta).*beta(end-6:end-1,:))-1; % The distance effects

bord = exp(-(1./theta).*beta(end,:))-1; % The boarder effect

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Then what the next set of code does is that it arranging the assymetric component of the
% matrix with the diagonal part removed (which is set to one). This is
% where one can interpert the assymetric componentn differently....

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Option #1: Interpertation of the asymmetric component on the export side,

% 
% ssd_stata = beta(1:N); 
% % Then in this case the S's are identified off the exporter effects (why,
% % the importer effects are ``tainted'' with the asymetric component).
